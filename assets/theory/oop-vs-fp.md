 ## Inheritance (Object Oriented Programming)

- implemented via `Class` and `extend`

- stateful

  - functions live together with state in one class

- Problems

  - taxonomy should be perfectly designed in the beginning, otherwise hard to make changes to hierarchy

  - can lead to "gorilla-banana problem"

  - tight coupling

## Composition (Functional Programming)

- implemented via `function`

- stateless

  - functions exist independently and can be reused everywhere
